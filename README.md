# 🚀 Space Mission Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Space Missions dataset containing historical records of global space launches. The goal is to analyze mission success rates, launch trends, company performance, and cost distribution.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical space mission records with the following features:

- **Company Name** – Organization conducting the launch
- **Location** – Launch site
- **Date** – Launch date
- **Time** – Launch time
- **Rocket** – Rocket name
- **Mission** – Mission details
- **Rocket Status** – Active/Retired
- **Mission Status** – Success/Failure/Partial Failure/Prelaunch Failure
- **Price** – Cost of mission (if available)
